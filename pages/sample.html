Strange patterns discovered around some of the joints on his body may be evidence of a surprisingly sophisticated system of medicine, researchers say. Some of these lines and dots are focused around points traditional used in acupuncture and could have relieved pain in his ageing ankles and wrists.</li></ul></li>

    <li class="Litem" onclick="dropdown('ul2')">These could have relieved pain in Ötzi's ageing ankles and wrists, experts say<ul hidden=true id="ul2"><li>The 5,300-year-old mummified man known as Ötzi was found in a glacier in the Alps in 1991, between what is now Austria and Italy. Since his discovery, the copper-age hunter has been examined by multiple teams of scientists, with new discoveries coming to light each time. It's believed he was hit by an arrow that delivered a fatal blow, severing the nerve to his shoulder and hitting a major blood vessel.</li></ul></li>

    <li class="Litem" onclick="dropdown('ul3')">They add this shows that his culture had already developed primitive healthcare <ul hidden=true id="ul3"><li>Ötzi's tattoos – which were created by a series of small incisions in his skin that were then rubbed with charcoal – were first discovered in 2015. Albert Zink, of the Institute for Mummy Research in Bolzano, in the Italian province of South Tyrol, was one of a number of scientists who worked on the latest paper. He says the latest findings show that healthcare at the time of the iceman was surprisingly well developed. Previous research has found that Ötzi was both carrying and had ingested a variety of medicines for numerous ailments he was suffering from.</li></ul></li>

    <li class="Litem" onclick="dropdown('ul4')">Research previously found that he ingested and was carrying various medicines <ul hidden=true id="ul4"><li>That includes traces of a type of fungus – birch polypore – found in Otzi's belongings, which have anti-inflammatory and antibiotic properties. Evidence of bracken, which was used to combat intestinal parasites, has also been uncovered in his stomach. All of this suggests Ötzi was part of a culture knowledge of anatomy and how diseases work, although its unclear how effective their treatments may have been.</li></ul></li>
